# **Transformer Summarizer**  

## **Introduction**  
The **Transformer Summarizer** project implements a robust text summarization model based on the **Transformer architecture**. This model utilizes an **encoder-decoder** structure and **self-attention mechanisms** to generate concise and accurate summaries of input text. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the model effectively captures the context and meaning of the text, making it suitable for various natural language processing tasks.  

## **Features**  
- **Transformer-Based Summarization**: Uses an encoder-decoder structure for generating high-quality summaries.  
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Captures contextual dependencies for better summarization.  
- **Positional Encoding**: Ensures the model understands the order of words in a sentence.  
- **Dynamic Masking Techniques**: Implements padding masks and look-ahead masks to improve training efficiency.  
- **Multi-Sample Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance on **multiple randomly selected test samples** for reliable benchmarking.  
- **Comprehensive Preprocessing**: Includes text normalization, tokenization, and addition of special tokens (`[SOS]`, `[EOS]`).

## **Importing the Dataset**  
The dataset consists of **dialogue-summary pairs** stored in JSON format. A utility function in `utils.py` handles dataset import, loading the files and preparing them for preprocessing.  

## **Preprocessing the Data**  
Text preprocessing includes:  
- **Lowercasing** for consistency.  
- **Whitespace and newline removal** for clean formatting.  
- **Tokenization** using a predefined vocabulary.  
- **Adding special tokens (`[SOS]`, `[EOS]`)** to help the model determine sentence boundaries.  

## **Positional Encoding**  
Since Transformers do not have a built-in sense of order, **positional encodings** (sinusoidal functions) are added to input embeddings. This helps the model understand word positioning within sequences.  

## **Masking**  
Masking techniques are used to improve model training:  
- **Padding Mask**: Prevents attention to padded tokens.  
- **Look-Ahead Mask**: Ensures the decoder only attends to **previous** words in sequence generation.  

## **Self-Attention**  
The self-attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input while generating summaries. It assigns weights to different words based on their importance to the current token being processed.  

## **Encoder**  
The encoder consists of **stacked layers** with:  
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention** for contextual understanding.  
- **Feed-Forward Networks (FFN)** for feature transformation.  
- **Layer Normalization & Dropout** for stable training.  

## **Decoder**  
The decoder is structured similarly to the encoder but with additional mechanisms:  
- **Masked Multi-Head Attention** to ensure proper auto-regression.  
- **Encoder-Decoder Attention** to integrate context from the encoder’s output.  

## **Transformer Model**  
The **full Transformer model** integrates both encoder and decoder, processing input sequences and generating summaries using attention-based mechanisms.  

## **Model Initialization**  
Hyperparameters such as **number of layers, attention heads, and hidden units** are set before training. The architecture is optimized for summarization performance.  

## **Training the Model**  
The training process follows these key steps:  
1. **Dataset Preprocessing**: Converts raw text into tokenized input-output pairs.  
2. **Loss Calculation**: Uses **categorical cross-entropy loss** to measure prediction accuracy.  
3. **Optimization**: Model weights are updated via **backpropagation** and **Adam optimizer**.  
4. **Epoch Monitoring**: Tracks loss values and training duration.  

## **Multi-Sample Evaluation**  
Instead of evaluating on a **fixed test example**, the model is tested on **multiple randomly selected examples per epoch**.  

- **Random Test Selection**: 5 random test samples are chosen in each epoch.  
- **Summary Generation**: The trained model generates summaries for these samples.  
- **Performance Metrics**: ROUGE and BLEU scores are averaged over all test samples to ensure **more reliable performance tracking**.  

### **Evaluation Metrics Used**  
- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**:  
  - **ROUGE-1**: Measures **unigram overlap** between generated and reference summaries.  
  - **ROUGE-2**: Measures **bigram overlap** for better contextual evaluation.  
  - **ROUGE-L**: Measures **longest common subsequence** to capture fluency.  
- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**:  
  - Evaluates n-gram similarity between predicted and actual summaries.  

This approach ensures that model performance is not skewed by **easy or difficult examples**, leading to **better generalization**.  

## **Summarization**  
Once trained, the model can summarize new input text. The summarization pipeline involves:  
- **Encoding** the input sequence.  
- **Decoding** with an attention-based mechanism.  
- **Generating the final summary** after applying post-processing.
