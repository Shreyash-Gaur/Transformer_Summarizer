    "Summarization is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful for a consumer enterprise. For example, bots can be used to scrape articles, summarize them, and then we can use sentiment analysis to identify the sentiment about certain stocks. Who wants to read an article or a long email today anyway, when we can build a transformer to summarize text for us? Let's get started. By completing this we will learn to:  \n",

    "## **Multi-Sample Evaluation Approach During Training**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This cell modifies the training loop to evaluate the model on multiple **random test examples per epoch** instead of a single fixed example. The goal is to ensure that the model is tested on diverse samples, preventing bias toward a single example and providing a more **robust evaluation** of the summarization performance.\n",

    "#### **1. Function to Evaluate Multiple Summaries (`evaluate_summaries`)**  \n",
    "- Computes **ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and BLEU scores** for multiple test samples.  \n",
    "- Takes a list of reference summaries (`references`) and model-generated summaries (`hypotheses`).  \n",
    "- **Averages** the scores across all selected test examples for a more reliable performance metric.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Training Loop (N Epochs)**  \n",
    "- Iterates through the dataset, training the Transformer model using `train_step()`.  \n",
    "- **Tracks loss values** for visualization.  \n",
    "- **Measures time taken per epoch** for performance analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Randomly Selecting Multiple Test Samples**  \n",
    "- Instead of using a fixed test example, the code picks **5 random samples** (`num_test_samples = 5`).  \n",
    "- This ensures that the model's evaluation is **not biased toward a single easy or difficult example**.  \n",
    "- The test documents are passed through the model to generate predicted summaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Displaying Sample Summarizations**  \n",
    "- After training each epoch, the script prints out **multiple test examples** with:  \n",
    "  - **True summarization (ground truth)**  \n",
    "  - **Predicted summarization (generated by the model)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Evaluating the Model with Multiple Samples**  \n",
    "- Uses the `evaluate_summaries()` function to compute the **average scores** over the selected test samples.  \n",
    "- This provides a more **stable and representative performance metric** compared to evaluating a single example.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Approach is Better?**\n",
    "✅ **More Reliable Evaluation:** Looks at multiple test samples, avoiding overfitting to a single case.  \n",
    "✅ **Better Generalization:** Ensures the model performs well across different types of summaries.  \n",
    "✅ **Prevents Bias:** Some summaries might be easier to generate, so averaging across multiple examples gives a more balanced performance measure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This modification ensures that each epoch provides a **realistic** measure of how well the model is performing in summarization tasks. 🚀"

    "If you critically examine the output of the model, you can notice a few things:\n",
    " - In the training set the model output is (almost) identical to the real output (already after 20 epochs and even more so with more epochs). This might be because the training set is relatively small and the model is relatively big and has thus learned the sentences in the training set by heart (overfitting).\n",
    " - While the performance on the training set looks amazing, it is not so good on the test set. The model overfits, but fails to generalize. Again an easy candidate to blame is the small training set and a comparatively large model, but there might be a variety of other factors.\n",
    " - Look at the test set example 3 and its summarization. Would you summarize it the same way as it is written here? Sometimes the data may be ambiguous. And the training of **our model can only be as good as our data**.\n",
    "\n",
